### Welcome and thanks. You're contributions are very much appreciated.

Weâ€™re excited to announce that the first Hugot Line website especially created for fans of both Tagalog and Bisaya hugot lines is finally here! It's just not a traditional website. Users can register, login and create their own hugot lines and share it on social media.

### What to expect

As mentioned above, interested users can register, login and create their own hugot lines. 
They can add photos to be used as background for the hugot line.
Simple advance search. 
Users can create, edit and delete hugot lines
Simple user profile with lists of their hugot lines created

### Continous development

This is an on-going personal project of ours and your feedback is gladly appreciated.
